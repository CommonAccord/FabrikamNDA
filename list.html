The following files are the (hypothetical) workflow on a request by Acme's in-house counsel for review and drafting by outside counsel (Quade and Quinn) on this NDA with Fabrikam.
Acme insists on keeping all transacting information in structured form. Acme also subscribes to <a href="http://www.commonaccord.org/index.php?action=list&file=G/IACCM/IACCM-ModelContractPolicy-CmA/">the Collaborative Contracting Policy</a>
<br />With that as prologue:
<ol>
    <li>
        AcmeGC_v01 is the work that GC has prepared, based on shared standards, and asks Quade to review.
    <li>
        QuadeRequest is the explanation of the assignment by GC for Quade.
    <li>
        QuadeResponse is a page set up by GC, where we see Quade's response with answers and comments.

    <li>
        AcmeGC_v02 is for when GC finalizes - accepting, selecting among or rejecting Quade's work. Ready for the next step - sharing with Fabrikam.
    </li>
</ol>
To see the workflow, the place to start is with the assignment to Quade - QuadeRequest. It links to GC's v01 and some resources. It also links to QuadeResponse.
